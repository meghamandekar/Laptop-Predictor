Overview

This data science project aims to predict laptop prices using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to clean and preprocess the data, extract relevant features, and train a regression model for accurate price predictions.

Features

- Data Cleaning:Utilize Pandas to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data cleanliness.
- Feature Extraction:Identify and extract relevant features from the dataset, such as processor speed, RAM, storage capacity, etc.
- Machine Learning Models:Use Scikit-learn to implement regression models for predicting laptop prices based on extracted features.
- Testing and Validation:Implement rigorous testing to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the trained model.
- Documentation:Provide clear and comprehensive documentation on dataset sources, model architecture, and usage instructions.
- User-friendly Performance:Ensure a user-friendly experience by prioritizing clean code, efficient algorithms, and seamless execution.

Tech Stack

- Python:Programming language for data processing and machine learning.
- Pandas:Data manipulation and analysis.
- Scikit-learn:Machine learning library for regression model implementation.
- Jupyter Notebooks:Use Jupyter notebooks for interactive development and documentation.
